# More EURECOM Projects

## Welcome !
This repository is a bit special, since it aims to store projects which has been done without using Git. These projects have both been realized while studying in [EURECOM](www.eurecom.fr/en), in my different courses. And I all enjoyed them !

The code may, however, be incomplete (or worse... oO). It worked well enough, but I can't say for now what I managed to keep in a good shape. Perhaps, are some pieces missing or non-updated (compared to the final version)... Anyway, by enlightening them again, I hope I will have some time, in a near future, to get rid of the dust ;-) 

## Presentation of the different directories :

- **Network Modelisation** : The purpose of this course was to study the main properties of big graphs (such that Facebook's one), and applying some queuing theory concepts on randomly generated graphs, which have the same properties of the studied graphs. In the two last assessments of this course, I had the opportunity to express personal initiative. Thus, I could reuse an old [project](https://github.com/AchilleSalaun/PAFSimulator) I did in [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/) (We were simulating the flow of customers into a fastfood restaurant), and turn it into a basic queuing theory simulator. By the way, in the second assessment present on this repository, I choose to crawl through Wikipedia, to get the shortest path between two links.

- **Advanced Machine Learning** : It was a 42 hours course whose 100% of the sessions were labs (plus one supervised by the company SAFRAN). We were cleaning data, and training Machine Learning algorithms onto the school's cluster. Unfortunately, I wanted to be able to recreate the work environment on my personal machine. I struggled hard (and finally failed :/ ) to set SPARK into a Jupyter environment. Thus, I lost a consequent time I would have prefer to use to go deeper in the analysis of the problems, which were given to us.

- **Advanced Statistical Inference** : This course was mainly providing us a Bayesian way to do Machine Learning. As a conclusion, we have been given the objective to study and predict quality of wines. It allowed me to go deeper into the notions seen in course, take distance with my result by thinking about the good way to describe errors, compare what I found to the results got by the authors of the paper, on which the assessment was relying on. I think it has been a real state of the art on what I was able to do at the end of my scholar year (M1).
